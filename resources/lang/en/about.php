                            designed a creative production process which involves 5 milestones, each being important vital parts of the creation of any
                             application whether it is a web app or a native one. We help our clients by creating them unique solutions to unique
                             problems, with us every client and project is important.',

    'planning-process' => 'The first stage in our creative production process is planning. This first crucial milestone literally sets the stage for the
                    entire project as a whole. We use the latest methods combined with the best of the past’s knowledge, to best understand how we can
                     help our clients, how we can best have them reach their own clients and to be as successful as possible. We work and plan with
                     our philosophy in mind, that there is no limit or border for success, there is always more to be gained and had. We usually start
                      of by having a productive meeting with the client, to fully and truly understand how and where they need help. Then we give our
                       initial inputs and gets some feedback, we take this and go and plan the project in it’s entirety.',

    'design-process' => 'The second milestone in our creative production process is Design. We start this step by creating the initial wireframes then moving
                onto more advanced ones until we have our final design. We select the most fitting way of doing this for each individual project. We
                 do all our work based on our philosophy: “Design is the power that creates opinion”, we believe that the difference between art and
                  design lies in the fact that art is only art, it lives only to be art it has no other purpose. Where design is in every aspect of
                  our lives, therefore we think design has a huge impact and importance. We help our clients by creating unique, timeless designs, we
                   combine old and new methods and theories to create the very best for our clients.',

    'development-process' => 'The third milestone in our creative production process is Development. We start this stage by writing the mockup, this
                                means we write the foundation using the latest html standards. Then we add styling to this using a preprocessor
                                called sass which then generates the css for styling the html. We do all of this based upon the principles of
                                effectiveness and scalability. Then we add the dynamic aspects using js and in particular jQuery where needed.
                                Almost all of our web apps are written in php using the framework Laravel. We always develop with scalability in
                                mind during the entire development process, meaning the apps will scale easily in size and with time. We believe
                                that every client should have an appropriate solution depending on their needs.',

    'finalizing-process' => 'The fourth milestone in our creative production process is Finalizing. It is at this step we check and test everything
                            before handing it over to the next step which is launch. We ensure that all text content is search engine optimized, that
                             analytical needs are implemented and running. Think of this as the pre-launch checks and tests NASA performs before the
                              launch of a space shuttle.',

    'launch-process' => 'The fifth and final milestone in our creative production process is as you guessed it: Launch. We have planned, designed,
                        developed and finalized the application and now it is time to finally launch it. This is a short step and the process itself
                         is highly customized to the needs of each client.  After the successful launch we always send a confirmation to the client.
                         We offer highly customized hosting options as part of our subscription service, which includes support, updates, and much
                         much more.',

    'thomas' => 'I was born in Vanlose in Copenhagen, Denmark. I grew up north of Copenhagen, today I live in Esbjerg, Denmark. I have always loved
                technology, but it was not until a couple of years ago, I discovered my talent and passion for web design particularly the development
                 part of it. I use mainly php and in particular my favourite go-to framework Laravel. I am by habit a solution thinker, when I see a
                 design or hear an idea I think of ways of implementing it. I never say no to a suggestion or an idea based on my current skillset, I
                  think that limits are there to be broken, and things are there to be learned. I use all the latest standards and features, and if
                  there exists no solution to a problem I create one.',

    'ilona' => 'I was born in Poland, today I live in Esbjerg, Denmark. Ever since I was a little girl, it was always certain that I was going
                to work in the creative industry. I attended numerous classes of arts and drawing. After attending plenty of art
                exhibitions I discovered that fine art is not enough for me, so I started to create digital illustrations. And then later I got into doing
                 websites and all other design work. I have a highly creative mind, with a high attention to detail and perfection, the overall visual
                  picture and message. I believe in modern, simplistic and timeless design. I consider myself a student of art and design, and
                   I am continuously honing my skills.',
